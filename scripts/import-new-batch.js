LLMs break this balance by making text production effectively free while reading still costs the same. Dumping walls of verbose AI-generated text onto someone — without review, editing, or synthesis — creates an asymmetry that the site calls "sloppypasta," a riff on copypasta. The site cites research on the increasing verbosity of LLMs and draws on Alex Martsinovich\'s essay "It\'s rude to show AI output to people."

    detailed_description: 'Obsidian is a local-first knowledge management and note-taking application that stores all your notes as plain Markdown files on your own device — no cloud lock-in, no proprietary format, your data is always yours. Its killer feature is bidirectional linking: create [[wikilinks]] between notes and Obsidian builds a visual graph showing how your ideas connect. This enables the "second brain" or Zettelkasten method of knowledge management, where ideas accumulate and cross-pollinate over time rather than being siloed in folders. Obsidian\'s plugin ecosystem (1000+ community plugins) extends it with everything from Kanban boards and Dataview queries to daily notes, spaced repetition, and AI integration. The core app is free for personal use; Obsidian Sync and Obsidian Publish are paid add-ons for cross-device sync and web publishing respectively. Beloved by writers, researchers, developers, and knowledge workers, Obsidian has become the gold standard for building a personal knowledge base that grows with you.',

    detailed_description: 'OSWorld is a research benchmark for evaluating AI agents on real computer tasks involving GUI interaction. Unlike text-only benchmarks, OSWorld puts AI agents in front of actual computer interfaces — browsers, file systems, applications — and measures whether they can complete real tasks the way a human would. Tasks span web browsing, file manipulation, application control, and cross-app workflows, all requiring the agent to perceive screen state and take meaningful actions. OSWorld was developed by academic researchers as a rigorous, reproducible framework for measuring GUI automation progress. It establishes standardized environments and evaluation protocols that make it possible to compare different agent architectures fairly. For AI researchers working on computer use, desktop automation, and agentic systems, OSWorld provides the definitive benchmark. The project is open-source and serves as both a research tool and a forcing function that reveals how far current AI systems are from human-level computer operation.',

    name: 'Shannon',
    detailed_description: 'Shannon is an open-source AI knowledge graph framework developed by KeygraphHQ for structured reasoning and persistent memory in AI systems. Named after Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, the framework addresses one of the core limitations of LLMs: their inability to maintain and reason over structured, evolving knowledge between sessions. Shannon provides tools for building knowledge graphs that AI systems can read from, write to, and reason over — enabling the kind of associative, connected thinking that characterizes genuine understanding rather than pattern matching. The framework supports structured entities, relationships, and attributes, with graph traversal and reasoning capabilities that complement LLM generation. Shannon is particularly relevant for developers building AI agents, autonomous systems, or applications that need persistent, queryable memory structures. As the AI field moves from stateless chatbots toward agents with genuine long-term context, frameworks like Shannon provide the architectural foundation for AI systems that actually remember and reason about what they know.',
